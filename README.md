visualize and consume the results in various ways.

## Prerequisites

```
Python 3.8
Docker 18.09.9
docker-compose 1.23.2
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter it:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/yahavx/mindreader.git
    ...
    $ cd mindreader
    ```

2. Run the installation script and activate the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    $ ./scripts/install.sh
    ...
    $ source .env/bin/activate
    [mindreader] $ # you're good to go!
    ```

3. To check that everything is working as expected, run the tests:

    ```sh
    [mindreader] $ pytest tests/
    ...
    ```

## Quickstart
After finishing the [installation](#installation) step, run the `run-pipeline` script to set up all the
necessary services:

```sh
[mindreader] $ ./scripts/run-pipeline.sh
...
Everything is ready!
[mindreader] $
```

Please note that it may take a minute or two for everything to set up.

After that, upload some snapshots from the [client](/mindreader/client/README.md):
```sh
[mindreader] $ python -m mindreader.client upload-sample sample.mind.gz
...
All the 1024 snapshots were sent successfully!
[mindreader] $ 
```

There is a sample example in `/tests/data/snapshot.gz` that you can try and use for start:
```sh
[mindreader] $ python -m mindreader.client upload-sample ./tests/data/snapshot.gz
```

After uploading, visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see the results. You can also use the [CLI](/mindreader/cli/README.md) 
or the [API](/mindreader/api/README.md) to consume the data.

## Usage

The project contains one package, `mindreader`, which provides the following sub-packages:
* [`client`](/mindreader/client/README.md) :mega: - sends cognition snapshots to the server.
* [`server`](/mindreader/server/README.md) :calling: - receives cognition snapshots from the client, and handles them.
* [`parsers`](/mindreader/parsers/README.md) :hammer: - processes snapshots received from the server.
* [`saver`](/mindreader/saver/README.md) :key: - saves processed data to the database.
* [`api`](/mindreader/api/README.md) :book: - an API to consume the data.
* [`cli`](/mindreader/cli/README.md) :memo: - a CLI that consumes the API.
* [`gui`](/mindreader/gui/README.md) :computer: - allows to visualize the data comfortably.
* [`drivers`](/mindreader/drivers/README.md) :floppy_disk: - utility that provides services to all the components

Click on your desired package to be forwarded to the matching readme, which supply a simple yet more extensive 
description, and also usage examples of the basic functionality.
